   *Quacklity: Guardian of data streams, one quack at a time*

Say hello to **Quacklity** (pronounced "QUACK-lity"), Stream DaQ's official mascot and your most
reliable companion for worry-free data quality monitoring!


The Name
--------

"Quacklity" combines *quack* and *quality*. We admit we're pretty proud of the wordplay, **but it's more than just that**.
The name represents our core philosophy: **data quality monitoring should be as comforting and reliable as your favorite childhood bath toy**.
Just like that trusty rubber duck, which made bath time fun and carefree, Quacklity ensures your data streams stay clean and worry-free, alerting you only when things get messy.

.. admonition:: Deeper than just a wordplay
   :class: tip

   Remember the joy of bath time with those trusty rubber ducks, keeping us company while floating through the bubbles ü´ß?
   Well, think of Stream DaQ as the rubber duck for your data: **keeping your streaming data clean and afloat in a sea of
   imperfect information**. So you can keep doing your super-cool data magic **carefree and assured**. Stream DaQ
   (and Quacklity) will always be keeping a vigilant eye on your data streams. ü¶Ü


The Story Behind the Name
--------------------------

Every great mascot has an origin story, and Quacklity is no exception.

**The DQ Dilemma**

When we started building Stream DaQ, we first did our homework.
We `dived deep <https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17507>`_ into the source code of 7 open-source data quality tools and
studied what other researchers had discovered for
`enterprise tools <https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data/articles/10.3389/fdata.2022.850611/full>`_;
all of them primarily focusing on static data. And we noticed something peculiar:
the vast majority of them used some variation of the "DQ" acronym in their name. MobyDQ, Informatica DQ, Deequ ...
the landscape was saturated with "DQ" solutions.

We wanted Stream DaQ to stand apart from the crowd, so we made a conscious choice: **DaQ instead of DQ**.
It was subtle but meaningful; a way to signal that we were approaching data quality differently.

**The Stream Connection**

With "DaQ" settled, we needed a catchy metaphor for streaming data. The answer came naturally: **flowing water**.
Streams, rivers, currents; all perfect analogies for data that never stops moving.
Data streams should flow smoothly, just like water in a natural stream.

**The Eureka Moment** üí°

One day during a particularly intense brainstorming session, someone on the team had a lightbulb moment:
*"Wait... 'duck' sounds just like 'DaQ'!"*

But not just any duck. A **rubber duck**! Suddenly, everything clicked into place:

        Bath time with rubber ducks was worry-free and fun, exactly how data magic should feel

        Your bath duck was always there, watching over you, just like Stream DaQ does on your data

From Concept to Creation
---------------------------

Once we knew Quacklity needed to be a rubber duck in a setting of flowing water,
we reached out to the incredibly talented **Maria Kavouridou** üé®.
We shared our vision: a rubber duck that embodies reliability, cleanliness, and the carefree joy of performing data
magic. Maria took our concept and turned it into the adorable, watchful mascot you see today.
