üìö Concepts
================

Welcome to the conceptual heart of Stream DaQ! Understanding these core concepts will help you design effective data quality monitoring for any streaming scenario.

.. admonition:: Why concepts matter
   :class: tip

   Stream processing and data quality monitoring have unique challenges that don't exist in batch processing. These concepts will help you think in "streaming mode" and design monitoring that actually works in real-time environments.

        **Data format strategies** - Learn when to use compact vs native formats and how Stream DaQ handles both seamlessly.

The Big Picture
---------------------

Data quality monitoring in streaming environments involves four key concepts working together:

   *How Stream DaQ concepts work together*


.. raw:: html

    <object data="StreamDaQ_animation.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>


1. **Your streaming data** flows continuously into Stream DaQ
2. **Windows** group data into manageable time-bounded chunks
3. **Measures** extract meaningful metrics from each window
4. **Assessments** evaluate whether those metrics meet your quality standards
5. **Real-time results** flow out as a quality monitoring stream

From Batch to Stream Thinking
---------------------------------------

If you're coming from batch data quality monitoring, here are the key mindset shifts:

   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 35 35

   * - Aspect
     - Batch Processing
     - Stream Processing
   * - **Data Scope**
     - Complete dataset
     - Continuous windows
   * - **Quality Assessment**
     - After data is complete
     - As data arrives
   * - **Time Handling**
     - Data is "already there"
     - Must handle late/out-of-order data
   * - **Results**
     - Single quality report
     - Continuous quality stream
   * - **Action**
     - Reprocess if needed
     - Alert and adapt in real-time

Learning Path
--------------------

We recommend exploring these concepts in order:

**1. Start with Data Quality** (:doc:`data-quality`)
   Understanding what makes streaming data quality unique sets the foundation for everything else.

**2. Master Windows** (:doc:`stream-windows`)
   Windows are the key abstraction that makes infinite streams manageable. Get this right, and everything else follows.

**3. Build with Measures & Assessments** (:doc:`measures-and-assessments`)
   Learn the building blocks you'll use to construct your quality monitoring.

**4. Deploy with Real-time Principles** (:doc:`real-time-monitoring`)
   Understand the production considerations for reliable streaming quality monitoring.

Quality Monitoring Patterns
-------------------------------------

As you explore these concepts, you'll start recognizing common patterns:

    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card:: **Volume Monitoring**
        :class-header: bg-light

        Track data arrival rates, detect drops or spikes in volume

    .. grid-item-card:: **Value Validation**
        :class-header: bg-light

        Ensure data values fall within expected ranges and formats

    .. grid-item-card:: **Freshness Checking**
