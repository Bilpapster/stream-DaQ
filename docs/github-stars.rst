🌟 Glowing Up
===============

Stream DaQ is and will always remain **completely free and open-source**. No premium tiers, no hidden costs, no "enterprise editions" – just a tool built by data engineers, for data engineers, out of genuine love for the community and the belief that data streams deserve the same level of quality monitoring as batch data.

Our small but mighty team of data engineers at Datalab AUTh pours countless hours into making Stream DaQ better, one commit at a time. Stream DaQ is our beloved side project, and we treat it like our baby. We debug late into the night, celebrate every new feature like it's our birthday, and genuinely get excited when someone opens an issue (yes, really – it means people are using our baby!).

The Journey So Far
------------------

Every GitHub star represents someone who believes in what we're building. It might seem like just a click to you, but for us, it's validation that we're solving real problems for real people. Here's our journey visualized:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
       <img src="https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=bilpapster/stream-DaQ&type=Date" 
            alt="Stream DaQ Star History" 
            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
   </div>

*Each star in that chart represents a developer who took a moment to say "hey, this is useful!"*

If Stream DaQ has made your data quality monitoring even a tiny bit easier, we'd be over the moon if you could:

The Dream
---------

So if that little chart above is going to keep trending upward, we need **you** – the amazing data community – to help us get there. Together, we can build something truly special.
