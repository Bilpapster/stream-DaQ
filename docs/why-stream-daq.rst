‚ùî  Why Stream DaQ
========================

.. todo::
   Probably here we could cover the cases when Stream DaQ is good fit and when it is not.
   For the other cases we should clearly point to static tools (e.g., our arxiv survey) and also to incremental approaches (e.g., Deequ, GX with Airflow, etc.).
